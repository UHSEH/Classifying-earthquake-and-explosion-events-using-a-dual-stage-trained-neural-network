In the first stage, its accuracy rate reached 96.61%, and the F1 score was 97.53%. After the second stage of training, the accuracy rate rose to 99.13%, and the F1 score was 99.14%. These results clearly indicate that the two-stage training significantly improves the model performance, and this method can be easily integrated with other models.
